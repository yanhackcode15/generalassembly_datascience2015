The dataset provided contains information about MPG and CO2 emission of 2015 cars. Given the dataset and pandas, please answer the following questions:

(1)	What car(s) have the highest MPG_COMBINED?

(2)	Which car(s) produce the least amount of CO2_COMBINED?

(3)	What is the correlation between VOLUME and the MPG_CITY?

(4)	What is the correlation between MPG_CITY and MPG_HWY?

(5)	What is the average MPG_COMBINED of “All Wheel Drive” cars with engine volume of at least 3.0L with even number of gears? 

(6)	Plot the histogram of number of cylinders for the above selected cars.

(7)	Create a scatter plot, scattering CO2_COMBINED against VOLUME. Do they seem correlated?

(8)	Create a scatter plot, scattering GEARS against MPG_COMBINED. Do they seem correlated? Can you verify your intuition with the correlation coefficient?

(9)	Create a scatter plot, scattering VOLUME against MPG_COMBINED. Do they seem correlated? What is the correlation coefficient?
