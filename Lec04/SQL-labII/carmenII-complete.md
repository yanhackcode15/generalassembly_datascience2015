# Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego?, Part II


	Good Work, Gumshoe! Interpol gives you its greatest thanks.

	As we speak, agents are swarming the Santa Monica Municipal Airport, 
	intercepting Carmen Sandiego on her flight from Brasilia.

	... 

	But wait! Carmen Sandiego has foiled us again!


We're going to use what we've learned already about SQL aggregate functions, grouping, and JOINing tables, and apply it â€“ to chase down and capture an elusive and world-reknowned thief.

Follow the clues, **write down both the commands you used and the actual answers.**

And figure out where Carmen's headed, so we can catch her and bring her in.


## The Chase

**Clue #1:** Someone fitting Carmen Sandiego's description just passed through the country with the highest life expectancy in the world. Which **continent** is she hiding in?

```SQL
Europe.

SELECT continent, name, lifeexpectancy
FROM country
WHERE lifeexpectancy > 0
ORDER BY lifeexpectancy DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Clue #2:** Interpol got word that Carmen is hiding in a country that has bigger problems than apprehending her. Which **country**'s GNP decreased the most since last year? Keep in mind she is still on the same continent!

```SQL
Russian Federation.

SELECT Name, (GNP - GNPOld) AS GNPDiff
FROM Country
WHERE Continent='Europe'
HAVING GNPDiff < 0
ORDER BY GNPDiff
LIMIT 1;
```

**Clue #3:** In the country she is currently in, Carmen Sandiego wants to blend in. So, Carmen must be hiding in the **district** with the highest total population. 

Each city belongs to a district. So, for each district, sum the populations of each city in that district and find the district with the highest population. You already know which country Carmen is in -- now which **district** is she in? (Confirm you are on the right track -- the district contains exactly 2 cities!)

```SQL
Moscow (City).

SELECT District, SUM(Population) AS TotalPop
FROM City 
WHERE CountryCode='RUS'
GROUP BY District
ORDER BY TotalPop DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Clue #4:** Immediately once you discover the district, agents flood the area to put Carmen Sandiego behind bars once and for all. Agents surround a suspicious ACME van, but ... again she eludes them! She's getting cocky again -- too cocky for her own good:

```
	Where I am now, I am finally content.
	Oh boy, and I didn't even leave the continent!
	
	I am relaxing in a place
	Where the district, city, and country are all the same.
	If you do not find me,
	You have only yourself to blame!
```

It's up to you, Gumshoe! Interpol is ready to spring on your word -- which **city** is Carmen Sandiego hiding in? **WHERE IN THE WORLD IS CARMEN SANDIEGO?**

```SQL
San Marino.

SELECT Country.Name 
FROM City 
INNER JOIN Country 
	ON CountryCode = Code
WHERE City.District = Country.Name 
	AND City.Name = Country.Name
	AND Continent = 'Europe';
```


###Follow-Up Challenges
